using normal CNN : 
Why your model failed?
Issue	Evidence
Dataset is too small	Only 148 training images
Too many trainable parameters	11+ million parameters 🤯
Flatten layer creates huge feature vector	86,528 features → leads to 11M parameters
No augmentation?	Even with light augmentation, not enough
Validation set too small (only 40!)	Leads to unstable metrics

➡️ This architecture is too big for your dataset.
➡️ You need either transfer learning or a smaller CNN.
